                                Hi! I'm Chill Koala, and I am a student. This semester, I took a class at Brown called User Interface and User Experience. This is my first experience with coding design, and I learned a lot throughout this course. Here are some assignments that I completed throughout my first semester!
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                In one of our first studios in this class, I worked with a few other students to create a high-fidelity prototype of our own made-up app, based on the interface of an already existing popular app. When designing an interface, you typically start with a basic sketch, with where you want buttons to go, and what kind of layout you want. This is the low-fidelity prototype. From there, you build on that sketch by creating a high-fidelity prototype. This is where you start adding font styles, colors, and pictures. The final hi-fi prototype should look the same as what you envision for your final design.
                                </p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>I learned how to use Figma to make a quick mock-up design of what our group had envisioned.</li>
                                    <li>High-fidelity prototypes are useful because they are more detailed and intricate than low-fidelity mockups, but they provide a solid basis to code a final product from.</li>
                                </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p><b>Interesting Findings</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>High-fidelity prototypes are often used at the stage after a preliminary sketch but before coding the final product.</li>
                                    <li>Figma is easy to use for a beginner, but it also has a lot of intricate features that it takes time to learn about, to increase the complexity of your design.</li>
                                </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p> My group decided to make a prototype for AstroPass, a Snackpass for astronauts. We looked at the Snackpass app to model a lot of our colors and font styles, as well as the layout. Then we added some of our own illustrations and example restaurants to make our own variation. Here is what we came up with for our final hi-fi prototype!</p>

                                    In my first project, we used a simple interface to practice thinking about design in a new way. I wanted to look at the treadmill, because it has pretty simple controls, and it's something that is commonly used but people don't really think about the interface. I started by observing and interviewing runners and walkers using treadmills at the gym. Then, I created personas for the people I observed. Creating a persona is kind of like writing a character for a movie. You write out their personality and character, but you also include their motivations, because you want to be able to envision how they would react and respond in different scenarios, not just how they would respond to using a treadmill.

                                    <li>If anything, the screens overall had more information and more features than were looked at or used</li>

                                    <li>I had imagined the treadmill experience with the preconception that everyone who uses the treadmill is a runner, but in my observations I was surprised that there were a good number of walkers as well, who were usually older</li>
                                    <li>I thought it would be interesting to approach the treadmill interface from their perspective.</li>

                                <p>I first started by observing users of the treadmill, and interviewing them by asking them a few questions about their treadmill experience. Then, I created two personas based on two main ideas that I gathered from these steps. Below are the empathy maps (description of what they would say, think, feel, or do) for two personas: Walking Walter and Running Riley.</p>

                                <p>Running Riley runs 4 times a week after work.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Represents the treadmill users who run for fitness and work up a sweat by the end of their run</li>
                                    <li>Pretty consistent about getting his runs in each week and strictly uses the physical buttons to change speed/incline because it is more reliable and easier to change while running</li>
                                    <li>Only uses the touchscreen to (1) change the TV channel at the start of his run, and (2) to start the cooldown</li>
                                </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p>Walking Walter multitasks on the treadmill.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Represents the treadmill users who walk to stay in good health with a relatively low-intensity workout (30 minute walk) while tending to other leisurely tasks</li>
                                    <li>Walks a few times a week on the treadmill with a book</li>
                                    <li>Does not look at the treadmill screen at all, since the treadmill slows down to a stop at the 30 minute mark
                                        The default page is the TV, but he does not look at it and it takes up almost the entire screen</li>

                                In one of our last assignments in this class, we learned how to use Flutter. According to its homepage, Flutter is " an open source framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase." A lot of our previous work in this course had been based in HTML and CSS, so this was a more traditional coding experience to learn. I designed a simple app to practice using the features that are built into Flutter.

                                    <li>Flutter can change the website based on states, instead of traditional logic. This makes things much more fast and agile.</li>
                                    <li>Flutter is easy to use and has a lot of documentation available online.</li>

                                In one of our group assignments in this class, we designed an interface for a startup, through an iterative process where we solicited feedback from our classmates after a preliminary design. After incorporating their feedback into our design, we then created a final design, which we got more feedback from through user testing.

                                    <li>The user testers had very insightful comments. Since they have experience testing many different types of interfaces for different purposes, they were able to quickly grasp our main ideas when they first interacted with our design.</li>

                                <p>After the design team iterated over the mockup internally, the hi-fi prototypes were presented in front of other stakeholders to receive feedback. Koko’s initial mockup was <a href="">praised for simplistic and interactive elements (the sushi and the cat</a>, however, <a href="">users were concerned with the design’s navigation and color scheme</a>.
